## How It Works

### Navigation and Smooth Scroll

- Clicking on a menu item smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section using JavaScript.

### Responsive Design

- The website is responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes. On mobile, the navigation menu is hidden behind a hamburger icon for a cleaner look.
  
### Interactive Tabs in the About Me Section

- In the "About Me" section, you’ll find tabs that allow you to toggle between **Skills**, **Education**, and **Interests** dynamically with JavaScript.

### Portfolio Section

- In the **Portfolio** section, I display some of my web development projects. Each project has a brief description and a link to the live project, hosted on platforms like Netlify.

### Contact Form

- The **Contact** section includes a form that visitors can use to send me a message. When a form is submitted, JavaScript handles the data and displays a confirmation message.

### Social Media Integration

- I’ve included links to my social media profiles, such as **WhatsApp**, **LinkedIn**, and **TikTok**, so visitors can easily connect with me.

  
## Conclusion

This website serves as my personal online portfolio, showcasing my skills as a **Web Developer**, **Virtual Assistant**, and **Social Media Manager**. It’s designed to be simple, 
interactive, and fully responsive, making it a great way for potential clients or employers to learn more about me and my work.
